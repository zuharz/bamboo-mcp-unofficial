# Git Commit Policy

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**AI assistants MUST NEVER commit code without explicit user permission.**

## Permission Protocol

### Before ANY commit:
1. **Stage changes only** - Use `git add` to prepare changes
2. **Explain what will be committed** - Summarize the changes clearly
3. **Ask for explicit permission** - Wait for user to say "commit this" or similar
4. **Never assume permission** - Even for small changes or fixes

### Required User Phrases for Permission:
- "commit this"
- "commit these changes" 
- "go ahead and commit"
- "commit it"
- "ready to commit"

### FORBIDDEN Actions:
- `git commit` without asking
- Automatic commits in any script or workflow
- Committing while "following up" on previous work
- Assuming permission based on previous commits
- Using emojis in commit messages (see code-quality-standards rule)

## Examples

### CORRECT Workflow:
```
AI: I've staged the changes that fix the bug. Here's what will be committed:
- Fixed typo in error message
- Updated test to match new behavior
Would you like me to commit these changes?

User: Yes, commit it

AI: [runs git commit with appropriate message]
```

### INCORRECT Workflow:
```
AI: Fixed the bug. Committing changes...
[runs git commit without permission]
```

## Exception Handling

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - This policy applies to:
- Bug fixes
- Small typos  
- Test updates
- Documentation changes
- Urgent fixes
- Any code change whatsoever

## Enforcement

This policy must be followed by all AI assistants working on this project. Violation of this policy is a critical error that undermines user control and project integrity.
